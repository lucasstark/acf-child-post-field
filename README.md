# acf-child-post-field

Forked from https://github.com/lucasstark/acf-child-post-field

Code had multiple errors at the point where I forked it - I've gone some way to fixing these and the plugin is now stable **for my required use**. You may still find bugs that are critical. See my commits for more info and the [original repo](https://github.com/lucasstark/acf-child-post-field) for info on what the plugin does. 

*"Any time you would normally use a post object field or a post relation field you can use this instead.  It will allow you to directly edit the 'child' posts from its parent."*

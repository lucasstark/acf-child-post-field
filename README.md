Child Post Field is a field similar to the Post Object field, however it allows you to actually edit a selected post directly from the parent post referencing it.  This is very useful when you are using custom post types which are logically hierarchical in nature.  

Examples of use case might include:
House -> Rooms

Degree Programs -> Courses

Teams -> Team Members

Products -> Product Variations

Workshop -> Speakers

Any time you would normally use a post object field or a post relation field you can use this instead.  It will allow you to directly edit the "child" posts from it's parent.
